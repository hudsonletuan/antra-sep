Controlling Flow and Converting Types

1. What happens when you divide an int variable by 0?
Dividing an int variable by 0 results in a DivideByZeroException at runtime.

2. What happens when you divide a double variable by 0?
Dividing a double variable by 0 does not throw an exception. Instead, it results in Infinity or -Infinity or NaN.

3. What happens when you overflow an int variable, that is, set it to a value beyond its range?
It wraps around to the minimum value in unchecked contexts. In checked contexts, it throws an OverflowException.

4. What is the difference between x = y++; and x = ++y;?
x = y++;: This assigns the current value of y to x, then increments y. So, x gets the original value of y.
x = ++y;: This increments y, then assigns the new value of y to x. So, both x and y end up with the incremented value.

5. What is the difference between break, continue, and return when used inside a loop statement?
* break: Exits the loop entirely and continues execution after the loop.
* continue: Skips the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration.
* return: Exits from the current method entirely, returning control to the calling method.

6. What are the three parts of a for statement and which of them are required?
* Initialization: Sets up a counter variable (int i = 0;)
* Condition: Determines whether to continue looping (i < 10;)
* Increment/Decrement: Updates the counter variable (i++)
Only the condition part is required; initialization and increment/decrement can be omitted but must have semicolons.

7. What is the difference between the = and == operators?
= (Assignment Operator): Used to assign a value to a variable (x = 5;)
== (Equality Operator): Used to compare two values for equality (if (x == 5))

8. Does the following statement compile? for ( ; true; ) ;
Yes, it compiles. The for loop has an empty initialization and increment/decrement sections, but the condition is always true.

9. What does the underscore _ represent in a switch expression?
The underscore _ represents the default case in a switch expression, which is executed when none of the other cases match.

10. What interface must an object implement to be enumerated over by using the foreach statement?
An object must implement the IEnumerable interface (or its generic counterpart, IEnumerable<T>) to be enumerated over by using the foreach statement.
